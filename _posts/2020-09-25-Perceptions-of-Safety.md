For my second build week project, I looked how Colombians view public safety and security. 

DANE is the entity responsible for the planning, collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of official statistics of Colombia. 
In 2016, they conducted their Coexistence and Citizen Security Survey (ECSC). 

Those findings are explained in detail [here](https://medium.com/@henrymead/perceptions-of-safety-in-colombia-c0137325c20e).

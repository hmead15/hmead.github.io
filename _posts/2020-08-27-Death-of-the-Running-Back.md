The 2020 NFL Season is approaching. With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to disrupt sports worldwide, it remains to be seen what the season will look like. 

Yes, there is a lot to dislike about The League. Some players are blacklisted for non-violent protests while others are welcomed back to their teams after dispicable crimes. Player health and safety issues are underreported. And ever-changing rules slow down the game and make officiating nearly impossible. 

Still, if there is no 2020 NFL season, I will miss it. High school football was formative in my life. I played running back for a small school in Washington state, and I studied the professionals closely. But as years go by and the NFL evolves, I have noticed that the running back position does not feature as prominently as it once did. 

For my first Build Week Assignment at the Lambda School, I quantified and examined some of my assumptions. I looked at NFL data from 1979 through last season (2019). Those findings are explained in detail here.

Some of the main takeaways include:

*   Running backs are rushing for fewer yards
*   Running backs are rushing less often
*   Running back-generated rush yards as a percentage of a team's total yards is decreasing
*   The 'TD Gap' (Rush TDs to Pass TDs) is widening
*   Quarterbacks are rushing for more yards
*   Running backs are less frequently picked in the first round of the NFL Draft

Further analysis is limited in part by paywalled-data, but mostly by a lack of expertise in data science techniques. That said, future areas of inqueries emerged while conducting my research:

*  What happened in 2015? Every statistic showed a down year for running backs.
*  What does a successful run-game strategy depend on?
*  Do dropoffs in running back productivity correlate with rule changes that protect quarterbacks and wide recievers in the passing game?
*  Will there ever be a reversion to the mean?
  *  Spread and uptempo offenses may take advantage of smaller, quicker defenses by re-incorporating power/zone run plays
  *  'Dual-Threat' QBs may complement, rather than take away from, running back productivity
*  Is there a similar productivity dropoff among college and high school running backs?
*  Is there a position where productivity is on the rise? Slot reciever? Tight-end?

Fun stuff!
